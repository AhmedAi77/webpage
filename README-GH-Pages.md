Publish site to GitHub Pages (PowerShell instructions)

Overview

This repository contains a static website (HTML, CSS, images). The included GitHub Actions workflow will automatically deploy the site to the `gh-pages` branch whenever you push to `main`.

Before you start

- Make sure you have a GitHub account.
- Create a repository on GitHub (for example: `your-username/your-repo`).
- Install Git locally and set up your username/email.

Quick steps (PowerShell)

# 1. Initialize repository (only if you haven't already)
```powershell
cd "c:\Users\pc\Desktop\my web site (3)\my web site"
# initialize
git init
git add -A
git commit -m "Initial site commit"
# ensure branch name is 'main'
git branch -M main
# add remote (replace with your repo URL)
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/YOUR-REPO.git
# push to GitHub
git push -u origin main
```

# 2. Let GitHub Actions deploy
- After you push `main`, the `gh-pages` workflow will run automatically and create/update the `gh-pages` branch.
- Wait a minute or two for the action to finish. Check the Actions tab on your GitHub repo for progress and logs.

# 3. View the site
- The site will be available at: `https://YOUR-USERNAME.github.io/YOUR-REPO/`
- If you used a repository named `YOUR-USERNAME.github.io` the site will be served at `https://YOUR-USERNAME.github.io/`.

Notes & troubleshooting

- If your default branch is `master`, either rename it to `main` or edit `.github/workflows/gh-pages.yml` to trigger on `master`.
- The workflow uses the default `GITHUB_TOKEN`, so you don't need to add any secrets.
- If you use a custom domain, add a `CNAME` file containing your domain at the repo root and update your DNS.
- If GitHub Pages doesn't show the site after the action succeeds, open the repo Settings â†’ Pages and check the source; set it to `gh-pages` branch if necessary.

If you want, I can:
- Create a `CNAME` file for a custom domain (tell me the domain),
- Update the workflow to run on `master` instead of `main`,
- Or set up a README with the exact repo URL once you create the GitHub repo.
